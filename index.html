                                <h2>Breaking the Dark</h2>
                                <h3>written by Lisa Jewell</h3>
                                <h4>read 23-09-24</h4>

                            <p>I blazed through this one and loved every word. This is the quickest I have read a book for a long time.
                                This book is unlike other Lisa Jewell books as it focuses on Jessica Jones, a character from the Marvel Universe. I liked the way that powers were handled in this book - quite subtly. Jessica only used her powers three times throughout the whole book that I can recall. </p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <cite>"This is the quickest I have read a book for a long time."</cite>
                        </blockquote>
                    <p>It is very much just a book about a flawed PI - one with the cliche of a drinking problem. However, Jewell humanises Jessica by making her pregnant, which means that alcohol is no longer an option for her and she can focus on solving the case at hand.
                        I did not see where this was heading, and I am pleased with the ending. It was as close to a happy ending as possible.</p>

                        <h2>The Deliveryman</h2>
                        <h3>written by Jeffrey Deaver</h3>

                    <p>This is another short and sweet short story from Jeffery Deaver, who never disappoints when it comes to a good yarn. The story is concise and to the point, introducing readers to two of Deaver's central characters, quadriplegic criminologist Lincoln Rhyme and police officer Amelia Sachs.
                        The story is good for reading in a single seating, or perhaps leisurely over two days. It has the hallmark twists that this author is known for and I was pleased to see that even up to the last page there was a major twist that I did not anticipate. </p>
                <blockquote>
                    <cite>"It has the hallmark twists that this author is known for...even up to the last page"</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>The characters are written well and the plot moves swiftly on, propelling the reader towards the end - as every good thriller does. This short story is a good palette cleanser between books. It introduces some main characters and the reader is free to read longer Rhyme books if so desired. There are currently 17 full length Lincoln Rhyme books.</p>

                    <p>I have just finished this book which I have been putting off reading for months. I can’t honestly say that I regret that decision because I found it not very engaging. The main character of Lee Mitchell is a likeable barrister who is quite high profile and makes very good money. However that doesn’t mean she can pick and choose her clients, due to something known as the ‘cab rank rule’, which states barristers have an obligation to accept “…any work in their speciality, provided they are available and appropriately compensated“. Consequently she is forced to take on a policeman who is accused of shooting an unarmed youth on the streets of London.</p>

                <p>This book has one and two words and phrases which highlight the fact that it was written by an author very familiar with the law. This was indeed one of the reasons I was attracted to this book. However, I feel that the story itself was kind of weak and the ending was disappointing.
                    Thank you to NetGalley and the author for the ARC.</p>

                        <h2>WIN</h2>
                        <h3>written by Harlan Coben</h3>
                        <h4>read 18-03-21</h4>

               <main>
                    <p>Like everything else I have read by this author, WIN was fantastic. I was very eager to know more about the enigmatic Windsor Horne Lockwood the Third and I was not disappointed with what I learnt. There were rapid bursts of action interspersed throughout a larger plot, which were a joy to read. The author grabbed my attention from the first page and didn’t let up once. Great cast of supporting characters too. One thing that did serve to break my immersion was the annoying formatting errors that occurred at the start of some paragraphs. For some reason the first letter of the first word was often missing, which meant I had to guess. Only a small gripe, but one I hope is fixed for paying readers upon publish.</p>
                <blockquote>

                </blockquote>
            <p>This is one I would certainly recommend to anyone in the crime thriller genre, and as an introduction to the suspense/thriller mastermind that is Harlan Coben.
            Thank you to Netgalley and the author for the ARC.</p>

                <h2>The Cuckoo's Calling</h2>
                <h3>written by Robert Galbraith</h3>
                <h4>read 23-01-2021</h4>
            </header>
        <main>
            <p>Before reading this book, I had watched the BBC series (that are based on the books) and did enjoy it, so I thought that this would be a pleasurable read as well. I must say that yes, it was great to learn more about Cormoran Strike and his secretary Robin. There are quite a few colourful characters in this book, who for some reasons almost all smoke.
                As the end approached and the plot twists kept piling up, there seemed to be one glaring plot hole in the whole book, which was never successfully explained – why is Strike hired in the first place to investigate Lula’s apparent suicide? The events set in motion (by the killer) need not have happened, because there was ultimately no proof. The blackmailer did not have any evidence; therefore the murderer did not need to set things in motion. After finishing this book, I really had to sit and think “What did I just read?” because it just doesn’t make sense.</p>
        <blockquote>

        </blockquote>
        <p>I also think this book is just too long, with too many excess words. Words put in clearly just for filler, which did not impress me at all. The story itself takes a long time to get going, with copious amounts of character description and flowery words. This may be great for some, but to me felt like wadding through treacle.
            Although I did enjoy reading this book overall, I won’t be rushing back to the series in a hurry.</p>
